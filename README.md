# SpaceEngineersScripts
A collection of scripts for Space Engineers

## Usage

These scripts are available via the steam workshop. To download and build the scripts clone this repo and open the .sln file in MonoDevelop on Linux. Unsure if this will work immediately on Windows also, but it should be compatible. You'll also need a Linux version of Sandbox.Common.dll and VRage.Game.dll for Linux in your references for this to work.
